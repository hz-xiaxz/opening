abstract = {In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the pandemic due to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 disease and develop a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by China, South Korea, India, Australia, USA, Italy and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the threshold behaviour of a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model with stochastic perturbation. When the noise is small, we show that the threshold determines the extinction and persistence of the epidemic. Compared with the corresponding deterministic system, this value is affected by white noise, which is less than the basic reproduction number of the deterministic system. On the other hand, we obtain that the large noise will also suppress the epidemic to prevail, which never happens in the deterministic system. These results are illustrated by computer simulations.}

abstract = {Bootstrap percolation (BP) models are systems where sites are initially randomly occupied. Those sites that do not maintain a suitable local environment of occupied sites are successively removed. This culling process can be identified with a cellular automation. Variations of the local rules concerning suitable environments, lead to different families of models, which have members with percolation transitions of the usual type, as well as representatives undergo different types of first order transitions. The latter transitions are manifestations of longer ranged phenomena in the systems. In this review different families of the BP type are introduced and their relationships summarized. The finite-size effects observed near the first order transitions are also discussed. Recent exact and numerical results are presented, and some applications and open problems are outlined.}

However, our results reveal that LERW on critical incipient percolation clusters is fractal with df=1.217±0.002 for d=2 and 1.43±0.02 for d=3, independent of the coordination number of the lattice. These values are consistent with the known values for optimal path exponents in strongly disordered media. We investigate how the behavior of the LERWp crosses over from Euclidean to fractal geometry by gradually decreasing the value of the parameter p from 1 to pc. For finite systems, two crossover exponents and a scaling relation can be derived. This work opens up a theoretical window regarding the diffusion process on fractal and random landscapes.},

During the past years, the emergence and evolution of Earth system science has attracted much attention and produced new concepts and frameworks. Especially, novel statistical physics and complex networks-based techniques have been developed and implemented to substantially advance our knowledge of the Earth system, including climate extreme events, earthquakes and geological relief features, leading to substantially improved predictive performances. We present here a comprehensive review on the recent scientific progress in the development and application of how combined statistical physics and complex systems science approaches such as critical phenomena, network theory, percolation, tipping points analysis, and entropy can be applied to complex Earth systems. Notably, these integrating tools and approaches provide new insights and perspectives for understanding the dynamics of the Earth systems.

Resistor networks, from which resistors are removed at random, provide the natural generalization of the lattice models for which percolation thresholds and percolation probabilities have previously been considered. The normalized conductance, G, of such networks proves to be a sharply defined quantity with a characteristic concentration dependence near threshold which appears sensitive only to dimensionality. Numerical results are presented for several families of 3D and 2D network models. Except close to threshold, the models based on bond percolation are accurately described by a simple effective medium theory, which can also treat continuous media or situations less drastic than the percolation models, for example, materials in which local conductivity has a continuous distribution of values. The present calculations provide the first quantitative test of this theory. A "Green's function" derivation of the effective medium theory, which makes contact with similar treatments of disordered alloys, is presented. Finally, a general expression for the conductance of a percolation model is obtained which relates G to the spin-stiffness coefficient, D, of an appropriately defined model dilute ferromagnet. We use this relationship to argue that the "percolation channels" through which the current flows above threshold must be regarded as three dimensional.},

Increasing extreme events are also considered to be a result of climate warming, and they may have widespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics, and political conflicts. Still, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations and climate models, constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here, we develop an approach based on network and percolation frameworks to study the impacts of climate changes in the past decades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the expected upcoming impacts using various future global warming scenarios. We find an abrupt transition during the evolution of the climate network, indicating a consistent poleward expansion of the largest cluster that corresponds to the tropical area, as well as the weakening of the strength of links in the tropic. This is found both in the reanalysis data and in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) 21st century climate change simulations. The analysis is based on high-resolution surface (2 m) air temperature field records. We discuss the underlying mechanism for the observed expansion of the tropical cluster and associate it with changes in atmospheric circulation represented by the weakening and expansion of the Hadley cell. Our framework can also be useful for forecasting the extent of the tropical cluster to detect its influence on different areas in response to global warming.},

We introduce a Loop-Cluster (LC) joint model of bond-occupation variables interacting with \$q\$-flow variables, and formulate a LC algorithm that is found to be in the same dynamical universality as the celebrated Swendsen-Wang algorithm. This leads to a theoretical unification for all the representations, and numerically, one can apply the most efficient algorithm in one representation and measure physical quantities in others. Moreover, by using the LC scheme, we construct a hierarchy of geometric objects that contain as special cases the \$q\$-flow clusters and the backbone of FK clusters, the exact values of whose fractal dimensions in two dimensions remain as an open question. Our work not only provides a unified framework and an efficient algorithm for the Potts model, but also brings new insights into rich geometric structures of the FK clusters.},

	abstract = {Using geometrical arguments it is shown that Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) must be confined inside solid tumors under natural situations. Aided by an agent-based model and percolation theory, the probability for a CSC to be at the border of a colony is estimated. This probability is estimated as a function of the CSCs self-renewal probability \$p\_s\$, i.e. the chance that an CSC become non-differentiate after mitosis. In the most common situations, \$p\_s\$ is small and CSCs are mostly destined to produce differentiated cells at a very low rate. The results presented here show that CSCs form a small core in the center of the cancer cell colony, becoming quiescent due to the lack of space to proliferate, which stabilizes their population size. This result provides a simple explanation for the CSC niche size that dispenses with the need of quorum sensing or other proposed signalling mechanisms. It is also supports the hypothesis that metastases are likely to start at the very beginning of the tumoral development.},

This endogenous network forms a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, with many stable attractors in its functional landscape. Normal or abnormal robust states can be decided by this network in a manner similar to the neural network. In this context cancer is hypothesized as one of its robust intrinsic states. This hypothesis implies that a nonlinear stochastic mathematical cancer model is constructible based on available experimental data and its quantitative prediction is directly testable. Within such model the genesis and progression of cancer may be viewed as stochastic transitions between different attractors. Thus it further suggests that progressions are not arbitrary. Other important issues on cancer, such as genetic vs epigenetics, double-edge effect, dormancy, are discussed in the light of present hypothesis. A different set of strategies for cancer prevention, cure, and care, is therefore suggested.},

Previous attempts to draw such a connection have been either unsuccessful or unsatisfactory. Considering each lattice site with an Ising spin occupied and the nearest-neighbor (NN) coupling between occupied sites as a bond with a bond probability p depending on the NN coupling constant J and the temperature T, we formally show that the partition function of the Ising model is the generating function of bond-correlated percolation model (BCPM) with a bond probability p=1−exp(−2JkT). The BCPM has the Ising critical temperature and exponents, including ν,ν′,η,β,α,α′, and γ (perhaps also γ′). From the connection between the Ising model and the BCPM, we also derive and hence give a geometrical meaning of the finite-size scaling and broadening at first-order phase transitions of the Ising model. Our approach may easily be extended to many spin models and give geometrical meaning to other properties of spin models.},

We show that the emergence of a spanning cluster in the Human Protein Homology Network (HPHN) exhibits similar features to an Achlioptas-type process and is markedly diﬀerent from regular random percolation. The underlying mechanism of this transition can be described by slow-growing clusters that remain isolated until the later stages of the process, when the addition of a small number of links leads to the rapid interconnection of these modules into a giant cluster. Our results indicate that the evolutionary-based process that shapes the topology of the H-PHN through duplication-divergence events may occur in sudden steps, similarly to what is seen in ﬁrst-order phase transitions.},

The particle size ratio at the geometrical trapping threshold, defined by three touching large particles, Rt=√3/(2−√3)=6.464, divides percolation behavior into passing and trapping regimes. However, the mean percolation velocity and diffusion of untrapped fine particles, which depend on both R and ϕ, are similar in both regimes and can be collapsed over a range of R and ϕ with the appropriate scaling. An empirical relationship for the local percolation velocity based on the local pore throat to fine particle size ratio and packing density is obtained, which is valid for the full range of size ratio and packing density we study. Similarly, in the trapping regime, the probability for a fine particle to reach a given depth is well described by a simple statistical model. Finally, the percolation velocity and fine particle diffusion are found to decrease with increasing restitution coefficient.},

The behavior of the model is determined by the temperature T and the concentration p of negative (antiferromagnetic) bonds. The ground state is ferromagnetic for 0≤p{\textless}pc, and a spin glass for pc{\textless}p≤0.5 where pc≃0.222. We investigate the percolation transition of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters as a function of temperature for large system sizes up to N=2003 spins. Except for p=0 the Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation transition occurs at a higher temperature than the magnetic ordering temperature. This was known before for p=12 but here we provide evidence for a difference in transition temperatures even for p arbitrarily small. Furthermore, for all values of p{\textgreater}0, our data suggest that the percolation transition is universal, irrespective of whether the ground state exhibits ferromagnetic or spin-glass order, and is in the universality class of standard percolation. This shows that correlations in the bond occupancy of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters are irrelevant, except for p=0 where the clusters are strictly tied to Ising correlations so the percolation transition is in the Ising universality class.},

	abstract = {The theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium is reviewed at an introductory level with special emphasis on the values of the critical point exponents α, β, γ,..., and their interrelations. The experimental observations are surveyed and the analogies between different physical systems - fluids, magnets, superfluids, binary alloys, etc. - are developed phenomenologically. An exact theoretical basis for the analogies follows from the equivalence between classical and quantal `lattice gases' and the Ising and Heisenberg-Ising magnetic models. General rigorous inequalities for critical exponents at and below Tc are derived. The nature and validity of the `classical' (phenomenological and mean field) theories are discussed, their predictions being contrasted with the exact results for plane Ising models, which are summarized concisely. Padé approximant and ratio techniques applied to appropriate series expansions lead to precise critical-point estimates for the three-dimensional Heisenberg and Ising models (tables of data are presented). With this background a critique is presented of recent theoretical ideas: namely, the `droplet' picture of the critical point and the `homogeneity' and `scaling' hypotheses. These lead to a `law of corresponding states' near a critical point and to relations between the various exponents which suggest that perhaps only two or three exponents might be algebraically independent for any system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, theoretical and experimental approaches to flow, hydrodynamic dispersion, and miscible and immiscible displacement processes in reservoir rocks are reviewed and discussed. Both macroscopically homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks are considered. The latter are characterized by large-scale spatial variations and correlations in their effective properties and include rocks that may be characterized by several distinct degrees of porosity, a well-known example of which is a fractured rock with two degrees of porosity—those of the pores and of the fractures. First, the diagenetic processes that give rise to the present reservoir rocks are discussed and a few geometrical models of such processes are described. Then, measurement and characterization of important properties, such as pore-size distribution, pore-space topology, and pore surface roughness, and morphological properties of fracture networks are discussed. It is shown that fractal and percolation concepts play important roles in the characterization of rocks, from the smallest length scale at the pore level to the largest length scales at the fracture and fault scales. Next, various structural models of homogeneous and heterogeneous rock are discussed, and theoretical and computer simulation approaches to flow, dispersion, and displacement in such systems are reviewed. Two different modeling approaches to these phenomena are compared. The first approach is based on the classical equations of transport supplemented with constitutive equations describing the transport and other important coefficients and parameters. These are called the continuum models. The second approach is based on network models of pore space and fractured rocks; it models the phenomena at the smallest scale, a pore or fracture, and then employs large-scale simulation and modern concepts of the statistical physics of disordered systems, such as scaling and universality, to obtain the macroscopic properties of the system. The fundamental roles of the interconnectivity of the rock and its wetting properties in dispersion and two-phase flows, and those of microscopic and macroscopic heterogeneities in miscible displacements are emphasized. Two important conceptual advances for modeling fractured rocks and studying flow phenomena in porous media are also discussed. The first, based on cellular automata, can in principle be used for computing macroscopic properties of flow phenomena in any porous medium, regardless of the complexity of its structure. The second, simulated annealing, borrowed from optimization processes and the statistical mechanics of spin glasses, is used for finding the optimum structure of a fractured reservoir that honors a limited amount of experimental data.},
